# Code-Lou-FE-project1
This project is for students in the JavaScript course.
There are 3 tasks to this project. Each task builds on the last.

#Task 1 Carousel
- A simple navigation system and carousel have been built.
- Students must write the JavaScript to make the carousel functional.
- Carousel must change slides when < or > buttons are pressed
- Carousel must change slides when radial buttons are pressed
- Students can decide to have carousel auto rotate, or leave rotation to button presses.

###### Solution on branch Task1-solution

#Task 2 Update Carousel Content
Students must update slide content using an api.
###### Mentor Notes
- If students need ideas for APIs, this is a list of publicly available ones (Authentication requirements are noted in the list): https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
- Unless they have a need to support legacy browser capabilities, we generally recommend using the fetch API for AJAX requests (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- Might need to warn about CORS limitations

#Task 3 Convert to React - Starting from an existing React app, add carousel as a new component
###### Mentor Notes
- Probably makes sense to use create-react-app to generated the base app since I believe that is the starting point for most of the Treehouse React work
- Maybe add one or two optional tasks for students who have a stronger command of React by the time this comes around

###### Solution
- Basic React app created on branch task3-solution using create-react-app
- to run project npm start
- http://localhost:3000 in browser to see project
